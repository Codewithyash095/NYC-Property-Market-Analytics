## 📌 Project Goals

- Perform detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on NYC real estate sales data
- Compare property trends across boroughs and neighborhoods
- Build predictive models to estimate property sale prices
- Create a complete portfolio-ready data science project for internships and Golden Visa application

## 📊 Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection & Cleaning:**
   - Sourced raw rolling sales PDFs from NYC Department of Finance
   - Converted and cleaned into Excel
   - Merged 5 boroughs: Manhattan, Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Price distributions, borough comparisons, monthly sales trends
   - Neighborhood-level price ranking
   - Sale price vs. square footage correlation

3. **Modeling:**
   - 🔹 *Linear Regression*: MAE ≈ \$2M, R² ≈ 0.0896
   - 🔹 *XGBoost Regression*: Improved accuracy, better fit for real-world application

4. **Visualization:**
   - Matplotlib & Seaborn used for plotting trends and relationships
