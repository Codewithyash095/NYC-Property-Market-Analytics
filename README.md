# NYC-Property-Market-Analytics
Predictive analytics and exploratory analysis of NYC real estate prices (April 2024 - March 2025).
# 🏙️ NYC Property Market Analytics & Forecasting (2024–2025)


TOTAL INFORMATION: 
This project analyzes and forecasts real estate trends in New York City using rolling sales data from April 2024 to March 2025. It includes full data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling using both Linear Regression and XGBoost.

---

## 📌 Project Goals

- Perform detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on NYC real estate sales data
- Compare property trends across boroughs and neighborhoods
- Build predictive models to estimate property sale prices
- Create a complete portfolio-ready data science project for internships and Golden Visa application

---

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Manhattan remains the most expensive borough by average sale price
- Seasonal patterns in monthly sale volumes were observed
- XGBoost significantly outperformed Linear Regression in predictive accuracy

---

## 📊 Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection & Cleaning:**
   - Sourced raw rolling sales PDFs from NYC Department of Finance
   - Converted and cleaned into Excel
   - Merged 5 boroughs: Manhattan, Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Price distributions, borough comparisons, monthly sales trends
   - Neighborhood-level price ranking
   - Sale price vs. square footage correlation

3. **Modeling:**
   - 🔹 *Linear Regression*: MAE ≈ \$2M, R² ≈ 0.0896
   - 🔹 *XGBoost Regression*: Improved accuracy, better fit for real-world application

4. **Visualization:**
   - Matplotlib & Seaborn used for plotting trends and relationships
